angular-lib-seed
================

Another Angular seed. But this time not for an app - it's for small library/reusable module.

Included:
 * basic structure of directories
 * basic Grunt configuration with dev and dist plans
 * basic testing infractructure
 * basic demo webpage
 * bower.json, package.json, .jshintrc and .gitignore files

Feel free to fork and adapt it to your own needs!


## After you clone it... ##
 * remove .git folder and init new repository
 * run "Find & Replace" function in your IDE/text editor and change "angular-lib-seed" string to your library name in all project files
 * run mass rename on project files and change "angular-lib-seed" string to your library name
 * analogously, change names of "angular-lib-seed.example" module and example.* files to name of the first component you want to include in your library (or remove example folder form `src` directory if you want to do it in another way)
 * in package.json and bower.json files - fill repository fields properly
 * remove this README and write your own :)
